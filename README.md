# CBTC
I'm delighted to announce that I've commenced my journey as a Java Programming Intern at CipherByte. Throughout this internship, I undertook several exciting projects, including "GuessTheNumber," "ATM Interface," and "Library Management App" in Java. I also had the opportunity to refactor and enhance my code, all while gaining invaluable knowledge and experience. Stay tuned for more updates on my GitHub repository! #CipherByte #JavaProgramming #Internship #GitHub #Projects #CodeRefactoring
